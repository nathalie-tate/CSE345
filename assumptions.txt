All packages have tracking

Packages do not have tracking numbers; They are tracked by their package number

Payment is due within five (5) months of the date the invoice is issued

Amount Due is the current account balance plus the cost of the current 
transaction. Amount paid is not immediately subtracted. For example, amount due
= $5 and amount paid = $5 means the balance is fully paid off.

Bills are always due on or before the 28th of the month they are due

Time to arrival is a linear function of the distance between the source and
the destination.

Different shipping rates have different linear functions

Distance between the source and the destination are determined based on the 
distance between the state the source is in and the destination state.

Deliveries within one state are said to have a distance of 0.

Distances for international deliveries are determined based on the distance 
between the state of origin and the destination country, or vice versa

Domestic deliveries have flat shipping rates regardless of the distance.

International, oversize, and hazardous deliveries have additional charges.

Shipping may be Express, Standard, or Overnight.

Only deliveries within the Continental US may be Overnight.
